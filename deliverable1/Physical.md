Phyros is a 17 year old football player born in Minnesota, US.
He's happy and sociable with a plethora of friends in Harding High School.
His life was full of challenges and hardships, given his lack of arms. Despite this, he remains vigilent and is eager to try new things. His parents are supportive of his lifestyle, though he experiences difficulty reading and signing official documents. Like most boys his age, looking at papers bores him dreadfully.

Phyros needs to submit his SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance) application. He stumbles upon Magnify Access and believes they provide the services he needs. 

Phyros prefers:
    - A Clean UI. No funny business. Just show me where to sign.
    - Electronic Tablets. (They have bigger keyboards.)
    - Wireless Stylus. Useful for signing documents on aforementioned tablet.
