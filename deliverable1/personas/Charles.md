Charles, a 25-year-old male, is navigating life with an auditory disability. He is an outstanding student excelling in arts and sciences, passionate in pursuing a postgraduate degree in Business Management. His dream is to create his own personal business. However, his condition poses unique challenges, especially when accessing digital information and services. He is diligent in researching and applying for relevant grants and resources that could aid his career growth. 

Given Charles' accessibility challenges, he finds it extremely difficult to navigate through grant application websites that rely on sound for informative feedback and videos that explain procedures or provide information.

<b>Charles' Preferences</b>:
- Prioritize visual information on feedback that relies on auditory noise, such as notification alerts.
- All videos should offer closed captioning and transcripts in multiple languages.
- Assistance and customer support contact should have the option of a live chat medium.
