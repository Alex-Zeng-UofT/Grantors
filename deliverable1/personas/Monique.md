# Monique, 32

<img src="../images/Monique.PNG" width="350" height="350" />

Monique is a passionate and dedicated 32-year-old educator hailing from the vibrant city of Montreal.
Monique is not just a teacher; she is the heart and soul behind a remarkable non-profit after-school program 
that focuses on imparting the gift of music, specifically piano, to underprivileged youths in her community.

Since Monique does not charge her pupils for the instruments or training sessions, she relies on government
and community art grants to fund her program. Monique has a busy schedule between teaching classes, music lessons,
and raising her two children, so she requires a grant application service that allows her to easily find grants relevant
her and her students, and allows her to seamlessly pickup where she left off when she's inevitably interrupted while 
searching and applying for grants.

Monique is also not a professional accountant, and thusly she would like the process of uploading receipts and invoices
for review to be as straightforward as possible.
