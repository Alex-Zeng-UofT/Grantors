# Monique, 32

<img src="../images/Monique.PNG" width="350" height="350" />

Monique is a passionate and dedicated 32-year-old educator. Monique is not just a teacher, but also the lead actress behind a non-profit after-school program that focuses on imparting the gift of music to underprivileged youths in her community.

Since Monique does not charge students for the instruments or training sessions, she relies on government and community art grants to fund her program. Monique's schedule in teaching classes and music lessons have been steadily outscaling her financial capacity. She requires a grant application service that allows her to easily find, save, and apply for eligible grants to help her and her students. Ideally, Monique would prefer a smooth application process.

<b>Monique's Preferences</b>
- Ability to search and filter for grants.
- Option to save grants and continue where she left off.
- Track grant application process and total amount received from grants.
