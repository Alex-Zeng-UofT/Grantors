Sal is the founder of AToZAcademy, an online organization that aims to deliver quality, accessible education. Sal values being <b>organized and efficient </b>. At the minimum, he would like <b>fast responses and feedback </b> when performing actions in order to react appropriately. As a part of AToZAcademy's new intiative in promoting accessibility through removing financial burden, Sal is looking to partner with organizations such as Magnify Access to <b> facilitate smooth opportunities </b> for students with disabilities to obtain grants. 

Ideally, Sal is interested in signing up AToZAcademy as <b> a client/organization </b> on the website. Users/students would be able to <b>register under AToZAcademy </b>, verified through AToZAcademy's registration, and <b> apply for grants under, or prioritized for the organization </b>. In addition, Sal is keen on <b>creating their own grants</b> to give back to the community.
