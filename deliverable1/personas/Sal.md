Sal is the founder of AToZAcademy, an online organization that aims to deliver quality, accessible education. Sal values being organized and efficient. At the minimum, he would like fast responses and feedback when performing actions in order to react appropriately. As a part of AToZAcademy's new intiative in promoting accessibility through removing financial burden, Sal is looking to partner with organizations such as Magnify Access to facilitate smooth opportunities for students with disabilities to obtain grants. 

Ideally, Sal is interested in signing up AToZAcademy as a client/organization on the website. Users/students would be able to register under AToZAcademy, verified through AToZAcademy's registration, and apply for grants under, or prioritized for the organization. In addition, Sal is keen on creating their own grants to give back to the community.

<b>Sals' Preferences</b>
- Fast and responsive feedback for users.
- Ability to register organizations as partners to create grants.
- Target grants for specific users under organizations or other distinctions.
