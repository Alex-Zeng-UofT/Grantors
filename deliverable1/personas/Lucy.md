# Lucy, 18

![Image of Lucy](../images/Lucy_Visual.png)

Lucy is a 18 year old high-school student, currently in the process of applying for universities. Because she wants to study outside of her province, Lucy is looking for grants to help pay for tuition and living costs. Lucy has Deuteranopia, also known as red-green colour-blindness as well as peripheral vision loss, which limits her field of vision.

In the process of filling out certain application forms for grants, Lucy found it difficult to distinguish between the words and background colour.

Furthermore, the formatting of texts on most grant application websites is dated, making it difficult for her screen reader to decipher and read out the text on the screen. Fortunately, she is still able to read the text, but must spend much more time on each application than compared to her peers. Additionally, websites that utilize large amounts of blank space, continuous scrolling (hidden scroll bars), and moving text as part of their design, make it difficult for Lucy to find the information she needs.

<b>Lucy's Preferences</b>:
- Ability to adjust colours of backgrounds and text to suit her perception of colour.
- Clear and intuitive formatting of texts, allowing for clear text-to-speech support.
- Compact and concise design when displaying information.
