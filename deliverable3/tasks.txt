Sean:
    - Unfortunately I couldn't finalize a single task this sprint. Health complications w/ relation to my left shoulder came at a bad time. As the sprint continued, I got better. Unfortunately again, disaster struck and stress returned my left shoulder back to its previous state (thankfully that was during a weekend.) During the final days of the sprint, I felt I had to push forward and work on my feature. As it so happens, I ate some 2 week old meat that was not supposed to be in the fridge, got a stomach ache that tied me to my bed that day. Hours later, my stomach was back at full speed! Now my head hurt terribly, and so I decided to call it quits for today and implement my feature next sprint. Thank you for understanding.
    - Despite the harrowing experiences mentioned above, I tried to help the team as best I could. Helping them debug stuff, discuss ideas, etc.
